        <p class = "p1"> I'am an 18-year-old first-year computer science student at Dalhousie University.
             I was born in China, but my family moved to Nova Scotia when I was 10 years old,
              and I've been here ever since.
               Growing up in Nova Scotia, I've had the opportunity to experience the beautiful landscapes and welcoming communities that make this place special. 
               All of my education, from elementary school to high school, has been right here in NS.</p>
                

                
               <p class = "p2">When I'm not studying, I love playing soccer and gaming. Soccer is something I've enjoyed since I was little, 
                and I still find it really fun to play with friends. 
                Gaming is another thing I enjoy; it's like exploring new worlds and stories, 
                and it's a great way for me to relax and have fun.</p>
